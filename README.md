# ColorChanger
This is the "Color Changer with Clickable Boxes", JavaScript-based web app that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on colored boxes. The application is powered by a JavaScript script that listens for click events on the colored boxes and dynamically updates the background color of the webpage based on the color selected.
